# JavaScript

### History
JavaScript! JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications. JavaScript was designed as a scripting language to be used with the companies web browser, 
Netscape Navigator. The company also wanted to be able to use JavaScript coehesively with the Java language, but they made sure the two languages were not the same. [1] JavaScript
is typically used for building websites and web applications, but has other purposes as well. Such as, game development, creating web servers, and mobile apps. [2]

### Getting Started
#### JavaScript Installation
1. Using your prefered web browser, search "Visual Studio Code Download" and download VS Code for your specific operating system. (VS Code was choosen as the programming application
because it is a commonly used application for different programming languages). 
2. Once downloaded and running, go to the extension tab in VS Code and search "JavaScript". There will be a JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippet extension that needs to be installed.
3. Once step 2 is completed, go back to your web browser and search "Node.js". Download Node.js for your operating system.

Once these steps are completed, you are able to run JavaScript.

#### Running JavaScript
1. In VS Code, go to the "File" menu, then select "New File".
2. Save this new file with a .js extension to show it is a JavaScript file. Ex: hello.js
3. In this new file, type the following code: **console.log("Hello World!);**
4. Return to the menu, and save your file.
5. Right-click anywhere in the file and select "Run". You can also press the play button that is provided in VS Code.
